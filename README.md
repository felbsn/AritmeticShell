# AritmeticShell
<h1>Usage </h1>
Compile the code or download the latest release of this project.
When you run the application you will be faced a console window.
It is similiar to python shell.You can define some varibale and process these variables with each other.
i currently decided to show only 2 point precision on float variables but you can easly change it , it only affect visual data.

<h2>Syntax</h2>

currently available operators;
```python
 + , - , * , / , ^ ,() ,= 
 ```
 all inital variablesho
 
 if you decide to assign some value to multiple variables like you can type;
 a = b = c = 24/(27-1);
 
 it is totaly valid but if you want to <br>
 a = 1/2  b = c = 24/(27-1);<br>
 
 you need to separate diffrent assigments with comma<br>
 
```python 
a = 1/2   ;   b = c = 24/(27-1); 
 ```
 <br>
 
 <h2>Note</h2>

When you declare a new variable  , name must be started with a character like <b> 'var0' ,'resul34'  , 'v1' </b> <br>
This project uses cvector & cstack library which you can find in [here](https://github.com/felbsn/CVectorProject)
 
 you can control shell with some special string which;
 <b>
 <ol>
  <li> clear:   clear  screen               </li>
  <li> show :   prints all defined variables</li>   
  <li> reset:   reset all defined variables </li>  
  <li> help :   print this screen           </li>  
  <li> exit :   terminate the program       </li>
  </ol>
  </b>
  
  <h2>Screens </h2>
